# Add the commands you want to run before each commit here!
# Syntax:
#   runCommand "<command>" ["<displayName>"]
#
# if <displayName> is omitted, <command> will be shown instead as a label
# in "Starting", "Finished" and "Failed" messages.
#
# Example:
#
# runCommand "gulp jscs"
# runCommand "gulp build:prod" "production build"
#
# This will output something like:
#   Starting 'production build'...
#   < command output >
#   Finished 'production build' successfully.
#   Starting 'gulp jscs'
#   < command output >
#   Command: 'gulp jscs' failed.
#   Commit aborted.
#
# Remember you can use 'git config commit-tagger.precommitverbose true|false'
# to show or hide your commands' output.
#
# Please be careful not to omit 'runCommand' and write the command between quotation marks.


# You can safely remove the following 'printf's:

printf "  You can run your own commands and tests in here.\n"
printf "  Run 'git commit-tagger set-precommit' to edit the configuration file.\n"
printf "  Only changes in the index will be taken into account.\n"
printf "  Unstaged files will be stashed and automatically restored later.\n"
