Usage: git commit-tagger <command> [<args>]

Available commands are:
  set-parent [<branch>] <parent>
    Specify <parent> as the parent branch of <branch>, or the current branch if omitted.
    This will result in a commit message tag of the form '[<parent>][<branch>]'.
  get-parent [<branch>]
    Get the name of the parent of <branch>, or the current branch if omitted.
  remove-parent [<branch>]
    Remove the parent associated to <branch>, or the current branch if omitted.
  ignore [<branch>]
    This will result in <branch>, or the current branch if omitted, being ignored, which means
    messages from commits on <branch> won't be tagged, and branches created with <branch> as base,
    won't automatically have <branch> set as parent.
  test [<branch>]
    Run the tests
